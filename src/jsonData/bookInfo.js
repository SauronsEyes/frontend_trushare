Learn to say “I do not know”. What is wrong with that? I do not know carries a tremendous possibility. The moment you destroy “I do not know” you destroy all possibilities of knowing. The very longing to know you destroy. Confusion is better than stupid conclusions. In confusion, there is still a possibility. In stupid conclusion, there is no possibility.” – Sadhguru",

Because of this, he discouraged people from pursuing the “natural state” as a spiritual goal. He rejected the very basis of thought and in doing so negated all systems of thought and knowledge.

His teaching begins with the idea of an ultimate Source, Brahman, from which creation arises. Once creation has arisen, the world and life operate mechanistically according to both Divine and natural laws. While people believe that they are actually doing things and making choices, free will is in fact an illusion. All that happens is caused by this one source, and the actual identity of this source is pure Consciousness, which is incapable of choosing or doing. This false identity which revolves around the idea that \"I am the body\" or \"I am the doer\" keeps one from seeing that one's actual identity is free Consciousness. Like other Vedanta teachers, Balsekar says that while creation and creator appear to be different and separate, that they are actually two sides of the same coin. He taught that life is a happening but there is no individual doer of life.",

His message, like that of his teacher Sri Ramana Maharshi, was always that the Self is already Enlightened and Free. Like Sri Ramana, he taught self-enquiry, which involved locating a person's sense of \"I\" and focusing on and investigating this directly. Famous for eschewing all forms of practices or sadhana, Poonja nonetheless recommended self-enquiry as the only practice one should take up, but he didn't want people to take it up as a form of meditation.
